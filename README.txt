In this project we are using the ReactJs Framework with the following packages:

1) Vite
2) Javascript
3) Tailwind
4) Along with the following npm installations: 
   	>) npm install
	>) npm i react-icons --save
	>) npm i --save react-type-animation
	>) npm i react-router-dom
5) For the taileind setup go on the official website of tailwind and follow the installation instructions given under vite+react framework.

After intalling all the said packages open up a terminal in the same saved folder of the project and type in "npm run dev".
This should take a few seconds to start after a link would be generated for the localhost, to follow up with the link just press ctrl and left click on the link and
it should open up in your browser.
If for some reason you are not able to follow up on the link, in that case just copy the lin from the terminal and paste it in the browser.

Reminder: This project uses reactjs, nodejs, tailwind so make sure all of them are installed
